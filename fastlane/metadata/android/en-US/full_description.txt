Geometric Weather FOSS is a free and open-source Android weather app.
It's a fork of the <a href="https://github.com/WangDaYeeeeee/GeometricWeather">original Geometric Weather app</a> with all proprietary dependencies and related code stripped out to make it eligible for inclusion on F-Droid. As of April 2021, this work has been upstreamed into the original app, rendering this fork obsolete. The new version is available <a href="https://f-droid.org/packages/wangdaye.com.geometricweather">here.</a>
In the app, you'll find:<ul>
<li>Real-time temperature</li>
<li>Daily forecasts up to 15 days, and hourly forecasts for the next 24 hours</li>
<li>Air quality and allergen information</li>
<li>Severe weather and precipitation alerts</li></ul>
The app has a strong focus on design, with a simple, clean UX, smooth animations, and Material Design all over, plus lots of customizability:<ul>
<li>Automatic dark theme</li>
<li>Custom icon themes</li>
<li>Large selection of home screen widgets for at-a-glance information</li>
<li>Live wallpaper</li></ul>
