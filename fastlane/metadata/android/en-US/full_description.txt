Geometric Weather FOSS is a free and open-source Android weather app.

It's a fork of the original Geometric Weather app [1] with all proprietary
dependencies and related code stripped out to make it eligible for inclusion on
F-Droid.

In the app, you'll find:

- Real-time temperature
- Daily forecasts up to 15 days, and hourly forecasts for the next 24 hours
- Air quality and allergen information
- Severe weather and precipitation alerts

The app has a strong focus on design, with a simple, clean UX, smooth
animations, and Material Design all over, plus lots of customizability:

- Automatic dark theme
- Custom icon themes
- Large selection of home screen widgets for at-a-glance information
- Live wallpaper

At present, AccuWeather is the only supported weather API for the FOSS version.

There's an option to donate to the original, upstream developer (WangDaYeeeeee
on Github [2]) within the app. This FOSS fork [3] is maintained by
mbestavros [4].
